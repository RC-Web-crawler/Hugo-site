#### Instruction
Users could upload the eCRF pdf file using new template to get the index for eCRF forms and map with SDTM domains.
According to alpha test results, the coverage rate is 70% ~ 85% and the accuracy rate is 85% ~ 100%. 

#### Limitation
As expected, mapping results for efficacy-related domains, like QS, ZW, are low in accuracy and coverage, since their
eCRF forms are always study specific forms
